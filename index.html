    <h1>My Journey Through Programming</h1>

    <p> Welcome to my first site as a beginner in programming! I created this after finishing the HTML/CSS course on Khan Academy. I will be updating this site regularly as I work through <a href="https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides">P1XT-Guides: Programming curricula</a>. Feel free to follow along!
